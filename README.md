# drinks
Searchable drink recipe list (alcoholic and nonalcoholic) using the public CocktailDB API.

## Additional features
Made the display rotate through a "carousel" sequentially of the search results from user input. 
Practically speaking it would be functionally more useful to have it either turn out one random choice from the search results, or sequentially allow the user to progress through them and see the number of results or names from the list.

## Optimizations
1. Language translation options for recipes (DE, IT, ES) as well as option to revert "back".
2. Some corrective processing of ingredient list and grammar - would need to rinse data through this step.
3. Allow user to choose to see video if it exists for a drink (though few of the drinks have this).
4. Filtering option for user and correct results display per above note on "additional features".
5. Suggested pairings (other API).
6. (Ongoing) Refactoring to streamline.
